- 👋 Hi, I’m @mighty-little-coder!
  
- 👀 I’m interested in building things. It started with Legos and then it was cars, and now it appears to be websites! I enjoy things that require creative thinking.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. I am in a bootcamp and we are now at the point where we are focusing mostly on server connections and supporting JavaScript languages.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new project ideas. I feel as though I have an opportunity at this point in my career to be a little loose on the projects I engadge with. I dont know where my specialties or even where my interest land me yet with coding. So I am open to learning those things about myself through creative and unique projects.
